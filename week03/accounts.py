"""This line of code creates a masked account number.
It starts with the string 'XXXXXX', and then adds the last 4 digits of the entered account 
number to that string. 
This technique is called string slicing, and it works by selecting a specific portion of text. 
In this case, '[â€“4:]' means 'take the last 4 characters'."""
